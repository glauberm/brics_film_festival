# 4th BRICS Film Festival

This is the repository for the Gatsby website and the Wordpress theme of the 4th BRICS Film Festival. Each one has its own README at its root directory with more information about itself.

## Gatsby website

The Gatsby website uses Wordpress as its datasource through the [`gatsby-source-wordpress`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/) plugin. It uses [`emotion`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) as its styling library, and [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

## Wordpress theme

Wordpress is used as an headless CMS through its [REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/), and it is enhanced with [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/). The theme's code follows the [Wordpress PHP Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/) and it will use [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for testing.
